## Exercise 02 : Do you know string??
> How deeply do you know about C++? Letâ€™s start from the beginning again.
The first one is just for using string. 

- Make the program as follows this:

        2. To convert LOWER CASE
    2. Use string classâ€™s functions
        1. substr, append, insert, replace, erase, etc..
    - The program gets two arguments:
        - ./convert {command} {string}
            - ex) `./convert up Iâ€™m the one!`
                - output:  `Iâ€™M THE ONE!`
            - ex) `./convert down Iâ€™m A SMall man`
                - output: `iâ€™m a small man`
